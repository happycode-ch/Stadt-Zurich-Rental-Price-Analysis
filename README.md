The city's rental landscape is characterised by high demand and a diverse range of properties, reflecting its status as a desirable place to live and work. This analysis aims to explore the variations in rental prices across different spatial units within Zurich, including the entire city, city districts, neighborhood groups, and individual neighborhoods. By examining these variations, the project seeks to identify the factors influencing rental prices, offering insights into the market's current dynamics and potential future trends.
